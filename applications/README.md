The easiest way to develop them is to have a local maven project,
running on openjdk8, with hadoop libraries.

Example installation process is described [here](https://www.allprogrammingtutorials.com/tutorials/reading-writing-files-in-hdfs-using-java-api.php).

Alternatively, the jars can be compiled on the cluster, [here are the instructions](https://janzhou.org/2014/how-to-compile-hadoop.html).
